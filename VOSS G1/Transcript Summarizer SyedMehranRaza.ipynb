I'll send you some material \n","whether there is appetite and interest and I think it's possible that we can actually do one of the two \n","things we can either raise once we estimate Does it cost in time and effort, then we can one is raise a \n","Grant application or contract application to NIH and things like that saying? Yeah, we will develop this \n","system and this is what it will do. Because they're interested simple that they want good applications to \n","come in because reviewing Incomplete or insufficient application takes time and energy of the side,… \n","Hamza Jahangir: but of course \n","Anil Srivastava: so they're themselves interested in that. And so that could be one possibility that we can \n","together if that is something that interests you interest. \n","Hamza Jahangir: Now we are already solved. We'll give you a demo. we're doing it from the inside the \n","agents view then it's going in right now DC gov is putting it into production procurement team inside \n","wants to write generate documents and… \n","Anil Srivastava: okay. \n","Hamza Jahangir: create so vendors can apply we have solved that we can even show it. It's now fully \n","work. So to me, it's just the Persona is on the other side of the fact that the same capability \n","Anil Srivastava: Yeah, yeah. Yeah Exactly. So. Yeah, so if that is of interest and that is a business interest. \n","I mean, then we need to talk about it because one is to get that funding the other is that at one time when \n","we were working using IBM Watson. We actually talked IBM itself was interested in investing into that \n","because they saw but Says, it's all over the place. So the other possibility could be that we can sort of go \n","around and find investors who say There's a market. And that as you said you even got the other side that \n","you got a mirror image of it from the inside part of the year the people coming together and thing. And \n","basically creating a partnership for that purpose. I mean, that's something I just want to leave on the table \n","on that and… \n","Hamza Jahangir: yeah. \n","Anil Srivastava: I love to hear you you've got. Showing definitely what you said that that's right because \n","my question is basically that after you everything is all right, what will take more for us to continue \n","working with us? Because at the end of the day, it's okay. Where's my Revenue? What am I getting? \n","00:05:00 \n","Hamza Jahangir: no, I mean that's the unfortunate part of being at this stage of the startup is I have a lot \n","of dreams… \n","Anil Srivastava: Yeah. I know that. \n","Hamza Jahangir: but prioritize survival and that's why again,… \n","Anil Srivastava: Yeah. No,… \n","Hamza Jahangir: I know we had some hiccups from December so All right again,… \n","Anil Srivastava: that's okay. That's me. Also had it. \n","Hamza Jahangir: I just wanted to make sure we are operating on the same kind of plane of where \n","sometimes we have crazy things happen and it could not as show itself in the wrong way, but I'll just say \n","that we are completely aligned of the thought process of this what we talked about in December few \n","guys. Remember digital tutor was the first thing we started with. \n","Anil Srivastava: Yeah. \n","Hamza Jahangir: I quickly realized that we tested the market and then walked out of that education \n","Market because there's just too much complexity in the way decisions are made and those sales Cycles \n","We would not survive this little cycle so that… \n","Anil Srivastava: Yeah. \n","Hamza Jahangir: but the capability we rebranded it from digital tutor to calling it knowledge Ai, and the \n","app is knowledge. I know it's across not just schools and education but any learning organization and \n","learner organization and then this build on top of that and we got three customers on knowledge but now \n","we're putting this the think of it as they come module on top of knowledge. I specializing for procurement \n","workflows because the customer is actually \n","Hamza Jahangir: One who brought us to this now. I have Chief procurement officer demos with a dozen \n","federal agencies who have exactly the same issue. They're like we can generate documents in under two \n","months and that's killing us. So can you just give us a tool that just generatively builds high quality. They \n","read the federal acquisition rags and then generate out docs the statement of work the day evaluation \n","criteria all the usual,… \n","Anil Srivastava: Yeah. \n","Hamza Jahangir: you… \n","Anil Srivastava: Yeah. \n","Hamza Jahangir: that's really not cotton pasteable, but it's somebody's brain that does it over and over \n","again and… \n","Anil Srivastava: Yes. \n","Hamza Jahangir: that person is now feeding into a model. So ranajoy wal I'm talking maybe if you can \n","bring up that the HUD procurement demo that Eric's always showing our if you want I can I think some \n","pineapple that Morpheus \n","Hamza Jahangir: But I think this document generation his soul it's basic but now it's what I'm playing like \n","we branded distance the second app that we're doing for the federal agency buyers hard and FDA labor \n","CMS DOD. A few others happening because Oracle is just taking us to every one of their friends and this \n","seems to be a very repeatable pattern now, we are all talking about. Okay. So, \n","Hamza Jahangir: Yeah, so expand the procure software and services one, right? Yeah. So if you look at \n","this create acquisition package reviews and approvals publishing the three internal steps, it gets \n","published then starts the vendor view. I'm thinking of creating the second module here called Grand I just \n","like this is the internal procurement AI then we could have a really good outside in applicant view. It's the \n","same things like and then Raja go into one of the statement of work doc. look if you look at this, this is \n","like a HUD law long statement of work templatized the Gen AI can yeah,… \n","Anil Srivastava: Yeah, yeah. \n","Hamza Jahangir: why don't you surrender explain one of these Maybe? \n","Hamza Jahangir: look at it's teaching the jet you just telling generator right this section because in the \n","documents area. I just uploaded old statement of works that HUD wrote and they write it in that same \n","voice the same laws and regulation check. So go ahead. \n","Ranajoy Bose: Yeah, so basically you can name each of these sections Anil right so think of it at Brands \n","document right so basically… \n","Anil Srivastava: Yeah. Yeah. \n","Ranajoy Bose: what we were showing you earlier in terms of writing questions, this is basically \n","generating text now we have actually created this sections for two things one is of course, to create these \n","sectional views of the document but also to keep in check the tokenization so there is a limit of how \n","much you can get in each query so this also help you, summarize your doctor then in shorter sections and \n","currently it's not working in this version but I mean we will be giving you the sandbox where you can \n","actually also see that what are the sources right if you remember the explainability so it typically tells you \n","that from… \n","Anil Srivastava: it's \n","Ranajoy Bose: which section it has been picked up and towards the end when all of this is done. I'm \n","gonna actually go down here and generate the document right? So if I generate this it basically get saved \n","and if I come back here that is this download button here, right? So I download this it's loaded here in my \n","Laptop,… \n","00:10:00 \n","Anil Srivastava: yeah, yeah. \n","Ranajoy Bose: so I don't have the Microsoft Word. So let me just open this one. \n","Anil Srivastava: One of the few people have found that you don't have Microsoft Word. Okay cops. You're \n","a really Brave person dominated world… \n","Ranajoy Bose: Yeah. \n","Anil Srivastava: where we all live to Microsoft. \n","Ranajoy Bose: So not on this one at least right? I have one on the Windows one. So this was a Mac. \n","Anil Srivastava: No, no,… \n","Ranajoy Bose: So, yeah,… \n","Anil Srivastava: I really up. Yeah. \n","Ranajoy Bose: So you have this document now loaded and you can just I mean anything also,… \n","Anil Srivastava: Yeah. \n","Ranajoy Bose: this is a rich text editor. So how we produce it was if you are doing a heading for instance, \n","Let's electron razor. Yeah. \n","Hamza Jahangir: It can you just for that go to the description of services section. I love that part of the \n","demo where Eric has that meeting transcript that ask the question on the chat or description. Yeah, this \n","one and maybe we zoom up a little bit. So Anil and Khushi can read better. \n","Anil Srivastava: I \n","Hamza Jahangir: This is a good example of how the workflow fundamentally will be different that this is \n","just like a generic boiler plate like you said right at this little Services now we did upload we said,… \n","Anil Srivastava: yeah. \n","Hamza Jahangir: hey this team just had a Google There was a meeting transcript. We could even feed \n","the video by the way now we can search video modality. \n","Hamza Jahangir: It will just read this. there's a transcript and now in the chat section, it's over someone \n","spoke about the requirements for this new thing that they're building now go back around just do that. \n","What did feel say about the requirements and the chats and the chat? Sorry on the channel. Yeah, what \n","did feel say about the requirements in the meeting transcript? \n","Hamza Jahangir: So I'm doing this demo, every hour days. \n","Anil Srivastava: Yeah. Good. \n","Hamza Jahangir: It's like ended in my brain. so that We're asking question of a specific document not like \n","blurring of the lines and… \n","Anil Srivastava: Thank you for taking time. \n","Hamza Jahangir: it says fear said for this AI project it main requirement is hard AI solution is to automate \n","and say they're procurement process. So rather just cut and paste everything from the main requirement. \n","into the description Services prompt scroll down to the description of services one. Yeah, so yeah,… \n","Ranajoy Bose: Okay. \n","Hamza Jahangir: just paste it into the prompt field after the right and just put us period and paste \n","Hamza Jahangir: And just generate now you see this boilerplate section in live will be Rewritten for an AI \n","project. Just look at the change that just happened. \n","Anil Srivastava: Yeah, yeah. \n","Hamza Jahangir: That's the contextual. So if you think about what is the different in Morpheus and Chad \n","GPT the level of contextualization now we can achieve which was our main metric API is how many days \n","can we reduce from the time it takes from a procurement from zero to published on their portal. And we \n","want to reduce. \n","Anil Srivastava: the opportunity \n","Hamza Jahangir: Accuracy and ranajoy's building this out for the end of month release at us, this level \n","now you can add workflow automate. We have no workflow Automation and notification so you can just \n","stay quickly send this section out to us me as hey check this AI wrote this, give your thumbs up and it \n","comes back. So AI I will actually now Excel do the whole daughter notifications for you. \n","Anil Srivastava: yeah, \n","Hamza Jahangir: So you minimize the back and forth this is wrong check this law document do this \n","compliance check all the usual back and… \n","Anil Srivastava: yeah, yeah. \n","Hamza Jahangir: forth time killer that is where I think we not only been doing generative high quality text \n","and then accelerating the notification and the workflow automation Downstream to get it faster out the \n","door. Yeah. \n","Anil Srivastava: I see I get it now. How much appetite do you have? And what will it take to take on what \n","we call my crot which is the applicant side of the niosh part of it \n","Hamza Jahangir: So this is what I just want to show you this exists today end of month. We're pushing \n","our first production version of this to our DC gov and now like I said, we're very popular all of a sudden \n","with Chief procurement officers, right? We have a Event in mid May to host 40 Federal AI officers around \n","procurement and… \n","Anil Srivastava: Good. \n","Hamza Jahangir: knowledge so we can immediately put this out in let's say May 1 in and give a trial our \n","early trial call it rebranded to Grand it's knowledge. with just a new narrative on top of it what we could \n","use from you guys in the next two weeks and that's why I said the structure process is now we know \n","much better what we need we need some sample docs and that is literally just an old statement of works \n","or any doubts that Karen or the use case needs to generate some examples of that. \n","00:15:00 \n","Hamza Jahangir: and just like what we're doing here some targeted questions or that may sharpen the \n","answer in this section of each or the documents. Whoever this me is we just need that's me to give us \n","questions and then say yeah the answer looks good. \n","Anil Srivastava: yes, okay that you aspects to it one is what you said just now getting the dogs and \n","getting the excellent that yeah,… \n","Hamza Jahangir: Question and answer is yeah. \n","Anil Srivastava: that is what we just need to find a time when we can only get to and I'll send you some \n","Docker the second part of it is the business model, okay, which of obviously, I mean we are equally \n","interested and so is Karen I mean what we need to do is to discuss is do once we succeed and I can see \n","that what you have done will lead to a working system where there is a service and we're providing to it. \n","so what is the kind of partnership between Three of us one side is carrying one side is us and one side is \n","you and both of us are part of the three very important legs of the stool. So what kind of partnership we \n","create and create between us? \n","Hamza Jahangir: I mean again we are doing similar exercises with others. I would rather not create any \n","custom bespoke stuff here. So we could give you the standard model that now in DC there's a lot of \n","people who are doing in fact yesterday at one with another resellers similar thing. I said, just listen we are \n","too small and too early that we don't want to overly die ourselves to some very we spoke thing I'm looking \n","for and I think this consistent together what I was saying in December is just we want to hand a \n","licenseable software and again just so you do but now pricing wise we've shifted away from user base \n","pricing because it was too much for user based pricing. \n","Anil Srivastava: complicated \n","Hamza Jahangir: We gave DC now CMS, which we're gonna give you the software to run on gpus \n","because product licensed by gpus and… \n","Anil Srivastava: mmm \n","Hamza Jahangir: add a support element if you want us to help, \n","Anil Srivastava: Yeah, yeah. \n","Hamza Jahangir: It's the CMS the standardized now. We just basically said here's a 50k pilot to all these \n","customers. We're offering a simple entry point. it's a 50k pilot to the customer for our piece GDIT for \n","example in CMS layered operation and management and there's me stuff on top of that. So they're \n","charging almost the same. hit up, but I don't think that's the right longer term view, but we have software \n","by gpus attend the $10,000 a monthly for this application to run on one GPU. It's almost hiring up an AI \n","worker for you a 10 grand a month. \n","Anil Srivastava: Okay. \n","Anil Srivastava: Yeah. \n","Hamza Jahangir: That's one software piece license and we said that whatever, you pay eventually 25% of \n","that we'll use as a metric to add support which essentially means you get human support and it's \n","dedicated to you. \n","Hamza Jahangir: And then you know that this at CMS we analyzed So the 50k was just like a box but the \n","full annualized 10K a month per GPU they won two gpus good for their production. They wanted a higher \n","availability. They have a larger user base to use this so that became a 300K a year production app for \n","Morpheus and then they're adding Hardware that they're so Oracle is our Hardware partner or GPU \n","partner. It's Nvidia. But Oracle is selling that in their Cloud environment and then there's services. So \n","roughly if and I don't know what grants Market will look like. I'm just giving you the commercial packaging \n","I have with this current product,… \n","Anil Srivastava: If yeah, yeah. \n","Hamza Jahangir: which is I think the appetite today if I go to the look at our competitors, they're putting \n","out million the lowest or if you do plus million, \n","Hamza Jahangir: Annual total cost of ownership. If you add up software service and services. We are \n","taking this thing with CMS. we're giving them 300 for us 200. I think for Oracle and GDIT still hasn't given \n","the exact number but we're gonna keep it below the Million number for getting and a capability like this \n","stood up which really and we've done some initial value convex exercise with their business line of \n","business users. This could save 50% of their time spend today on writing these documents and doing a \n","lot of this stuff. So I'll use there but we're just making the entry point that hey start small feet to try this \n","and then 300 a year. \n","00:20:00 \n","Anil Srivastava: There's sorry. what 50 is the initial? \n","Hamza Jahangir: 50 is a pilot for two months. \n","Anil Srivastava: Okay, okay. \n","Hamza Jahangir: And that's where it's a educational exercise for the customer… \n","Anil Srivastava: Yeah. \n","Hamza Jahangir: because nobody understands how to use the trainer model or… \n","Anil Srivastava: right \n","Hamza Jahangir: generative way we are doing this for CMS. Ranajoy and I were on the call right before \n","we're educating every day. \n","Anil Srivastava: So let's do a couple of things. So you one is if you can put the numbers that you're talking \n","about. Just an email. \n","Hamza Jahangir: I'll send you the deck. \n","Hamza Jahangir: I'll send you a deck. \n","Anil Srivastava: Okay, you send the textual and… \n","Anil Srivastava: doesn't seem unreasonable it was because the businessman the second thing is that \n","Karen and on outside there is very little resource that we have. I mean Khushi me a couple of other \n","people, so we're not going to go around building the capability in house, but we were getting from you. I \n","mean because We will just be the interface to the market. and Part of the subject matter special and of \n","course bringing the money that you need in order to be engaged. I mean What he… \n","Hamza Jahangir: Yes. \n","Anil Srivastava: where 50? so let us do one thing this Set up a time later next week. When I send you \n","some of the material prepare Karen to understand it and bring those things to you. And this sort of see… \n","Hamza Jahangir: Yep. \n","Anil Srivastava: what will it take, to get to a point. \n","Hamza Jahangir: If we can talk about the reseller fee that again full transparency and what I'm offering to \n","everybody else now multi-country not one is 10% straight off the top for whatever deals you guys bring to \n","me it's almost like I'm giving you a commission model to resell, to the use case in the markets that I want \n","strategically and then we're adding Five Points five accelerators on top of the 10 percent so it could go up \n","to 15 standard stuff. again if it's real users at a certain, capacity if it's a certain deal size or it grows within \n","a 12 month period if we start seeing growth there's some fairly logical accelerators. \n","Anil Srivastava: Good how Hamza it won't work in our case for a simple reason that a lot of value add \n","that we have to put… \n","Hamza Jahangir: We're actually as incentives. \n","Anil Srivastava: because what the content goes into the document. \n","Hamza Jahangir: No, yes. I'm talking this is straight off the top of soft not service. \n","Anil Srivastava: yeah, so get No, the way it will work very well with us is that we do it as almost like a \n","OEM with you say, okay, you're going to charge us this much for providing this software being and then \n","we say okay on top of it. What are the other services we have to add on so basically it will be William \n","Revenue to you for the software and… \n","Hamza Jahangir: and… \n","Anil Srivastava: We don't want to do anything about the software. We really want to be any user on behalf \n","of our customers. I mean it, okay. \n","Hamza Jahangir: that's the easy then it's just like you put a Services layer and… \n","Anil Srivastava: Yeah. Yeah. \n","Hamza Jahangir: we'll just over just offering is the software OEM \n","Anil Srivastava: And It's okay. So let's find a time next week when people are running Jay and you have \n","time to demo it whatever with it and I will check with the \n","Hamza Jahangir: Then we need the content right the documents and… \n","Anil Srivastava: Yeah that I'll send it. \n","Hamza Jahangir: the question. \n","Anil Srivastava: I'll send it over the third and I'll also send you a narrative description that we had of the \n","service which is very similar to what you're talking about. There's not very different. it's only that't the \n","applicant side is not on the document creator side so that is… \n","Hamza Jahangir: the federal employees \n","Anil Srivastava: why this is so it is on the Okay, and then get together and see what is taken. let me go \n","and find the money to engage with you and pay you for it because what you should \n","Hamza Jahangir: Yeah, guys the deck if this is just I think this is now becoming pretty like cooking cookie \n","cutter ish. \n","Anil Srivastava: good here. \n","Hamza Jahangir: But always the hard part is technically that's why I'm just gonna maybe end of month \n","this becomes GA for these customers. I want to do the right thing of giving you a trial account that we can \n","stand behind and support and all of that. So ranajoy then maybe this month and we can set up date by \n","which we can have a new Fresh with the document generation capability have a trial and instance ready, \n","but to put in your you guys as hand but I wouldn't and my only thing is it takes gpus cost a lot of money \n","and… \n","00:25:00 \n","Anil Srivastava: Yes, I know. \n","Hamza Jahangir: we have a really structure and state of where do we take this? How do we make this \n","turn this into a \n","Anil Srivastava: No different. \n","Hamza Jahangir: You guys have a trial but at least then we just go and… \n","Anil Srivastava: Then we definitely need no no,… \n","Hamza Jahangir: let's don't put into. \n","Anil Srivastava: let's definitely do that. Let's work it out. and what we can do one of the ways to do it \n","would be to take because we have real customers to get to so basically take a real customer take a \n","contract and say What is the subcontract part to Morpheus on that and… \n","Hamza Jahangir: Correct. Yes. \n","Anil Srivastava: we can do simple by incre by customer so we can work how about early me but I mean Is \n","that work for you? \n","Hamza Jahangir: Yeah, I mean we are release date of this end of April. So early May is perfectly from a \n","giving you the software in your hands. \n","Anil Srivastava: Okay, yeah. It is there any particular day of the week that is that both of you are \n","comfortable time of the week or who that would no? \n","Hamza Jahangir: Next week or what? Are you? \n","Anil Srivastava: Okay. Let's keep it an early May. Next week. \n","Hamza Jahangir: it's for \n","Anil Srivastava: I'm traveling for the three days to bio it and I'm only back on Wednesday night, so \n","Hamza Jahangir: Yeah, I mean you tell us it's hard for me to right now. I don't it's open. \n","Anil Srivastava: Okay, I'll tell you a let me talk to Karen I'll send you and… \n","Hamza Jahangir: So we \n","Hamza Jahangir: yeah. \n","Anil Srivastava: what I mean Khushi and I will work on assembling whatever little capabilities that we \n","have in order to be the interface between your technology and the market. I mean you really with Karen \n","the subject matter specialist and be able to because we are ourselves a user. I mean that now \n","Hamza Jahangir: So you're sorry early May you're talking about a demo to Karen. \n","Anil Srivastava: yeah, I would get substantial discussion too with care and \n","Hamza Jahangir: I mean, I was that works fine for us. I was saying I was talking about May early may we \n","would give you the actual a trial instance whenever you want to have a conversation with Karen before \n","that we can I mean… \n","Anil Srivastava: Okay, okay. \n","Hamza Jahangir: if we get the yard without throw it into my instance and… \n","Anil Srivastava: No, no,… \n","Hamza Jahangir: we can show her, \n","Anil Srivastava: I'd send you the material. There's no Pro problem. I'll send you the material. There's some \n","solid repairs. \n","Hamza Jahangir: I'm saying if you needed or wanted to have a earlier conversation about the packaging \n","and the commercialization with Karen happy to do that before may… \n","Anil Srivastava: Yeah. \n","Hamza Jahangir: but would be when the thing actually would be practical. \n","Anil Srivastava: Okay, so I'll get my Karen and Martin on to the call and I'll get back with some dates for \n","sure. \n","Hamza Jahangir: and anytime \n","Anil Srivastava: Yeah, we do that so that was the other thing is you said you were going to have a \n","meeting of this procurement officers and Mail what we did. \n","Hamza Jahangir: Then meeting them. I like next week. \n","Hamza Jahangir: I'm meeting. the \n","Anil Srivastava: No. No,… \n","Anil Srivastava: you said you're going to put some kind of even together for them, \n","Hamza Jahangir: yeah, that's the Oracle event it May 15th or 16 to forget. \n","Anil Srivastava: do you have anybody from NIH in that procurement of Superman age? \n","Hamza Jahangir: This Oracle is and another Oracle partner called mythics is hosting and invite doing all \n","the invitations. So if you have anyone happy to them in. \n","Anil Srivastava: Okay, I will try to come up with the name and send it to you because \n","Hamza Jahangir: We are not good. We are just showing up. They told us invite your customers,… \n","Anil Srivastava: yeah. \n","Hamza Jahangir: but we are showing up. We're not running the event. \n","Anil Srivastava: so No, no. Okay. So I'll try to find you some quite independent of what we are talking \n","about because they have the same pain that you talking about CMS and everybody else of generating. \n","These are face the same problem and… \n","Hamza Jahangir: Good. Yep. \n","Anil Srivastava: they actually working of the same TFR. I mean the government Roots it's all identical is \n","just a domain is different. \n","Hamza Jahangir: the next thing yeah. \n","Anil Srivastava: I mean so you Oracle might find different. let's just do that. So Khushi and I will work on it \n","gather people get the information onto the drive. I will look at the use case and we'd set up a call with \n","Martin and Karen and of course asked to understand little better. I \n","Hamza Jahangir: Sure. \n","Anil Srivastava: I have a bad habit of going by the gut field to understand things that I do what you're \n","offerings you understand what but I need to get others to buy into it and to understand what they're \n","getting into and then let's really start with it. And also what the opportunity we can possibly in next month \n","or so, we can actually generate customers and take that into I mean, I'll be Plan B will always be that if \n","Morpheus sedition doesn't work. We'll have to go to the old Flintstone work to manual to do that. So the \n","contract is not dependent on \n","00:30:00 \n","Anil Srivastava: Would cook it. so Let's do that. And send me the deck that will help me to convince these \n","two people and… \n","Hamza Jahangir: I'll send you the right after this my \n","Anil Srivastava: yeah, yeah and said to me and I think I see what you're saying that Is that matter of \n","customization matter of putting it all together, but what you described as a process what it should be in \n","the problem is exactly the process that we need in my crop what we call Micro I mean and… \n","Hamza Jahangir: Okay. \n","Anil Srivastava: I'll send you this narrative. Hey Khushi any good anything from your side? \n","Khushi Sharma: Lord \n","Anil Srivastava: Okay, so we'll follow it up with you and thank you very much for your time. I mean, thank \n","you. Bye bye. \n","Hamza Jahangir: All right. Thanks Anil. Take care. \n","Ranajoy Bose: Thank you. \n","Anil Srivastava: Take care. \n","Meeting ended after 00:31:10   \n"," \n","```\n","              SUMMARY:\n","            The meeting is between Anil Srivastava and Hamza Jabir to discuss business opportunities and a possible partnership for their respective AI-based document generation software.
